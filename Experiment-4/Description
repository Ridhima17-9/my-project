# Purpose:

This feature shows how many characters a user types in a text area — instantly.

# How It Works:

* You type in a box (textarea).
* A number below it shows the live character count.
* It updates every time you type or delete.
* It counts everything: letters, spaces, numbers, and symbols.
* If nothing is typed, it shows 0.

# Examples:

* "World" → 5
* "AI Model" → 8
* " " (3 spaces) → 3
* "" (empty) → 0

# Behind the Scenes (Steps):

* JavaScript listens using input event.
* It checks length using .length.
* Updates a <span> to show the count.

# Why It’s Useful:

* No page reload needed.
* Used in social media posts, feedback forms, etc.
* Helps users know character limits.

# What You Learn:
