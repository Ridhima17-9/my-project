# Technologies Used:

* HTML5 – Structure of product list and dropdown menu.
* CSS3 – Styling of container, dropdown, and product cards in a grid layout.
* JavaScript – Filtering functionality for showing/hiding products dynamically.

# Project Overview:

* A Dynamic Product Filtering System where users select a category (Clothing, Electronics, Books, etc.) and the displayed product list updates instantly.
* The main goal is to practice real-time DOM manipulation using data attributes for categorization.
* This feature is widely used in e-commerce websites (like Amazon, Flipkart) for product filtering.

# Structure:

* Dropdown Menu (Filter Control):
Provides category options (All, Clothing, Electronics, Books).
Connected to JavaScript to trigger filtering whenever the user changes the category.

* Product List (Grid of Items):
Products displayed as cards with category attributes.
Helps identify and filter items according to the selected option.

* JavaScript Filtering Functionality:
Captures selected category from dropdown.
Loops through all products and hides those that don’t match.
If “All” is selected, every product is shown.

* CSS Styling:
Products styled as cards in a neat grid layout.
Dropdown styled with padding, spacing, and hover effects.
Product cards have shadows, borders, and spacing for a modern look.

# Learning Outcomes:

* Learned how to use data attributes in HTML for product categorization.
* Understood real-time DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
* Practiced implementing event listeners for dropdown interaction.
* Improved CSS skills by designing responsive product cards and grids.
* Gained exposure to a real-world e-commerce feature.

# Key Concepts:

* DOM Selection & Manipulation
* Data Attributes for categorization
