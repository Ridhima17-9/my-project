The project involves designing a banking dashboard that displays:

Current balance

Deposit button

Withdraw button

The interface should:

Look visually clean and well-aligned.

Be centered on the page.

Adjust layout responsively for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

 HTML Structure Features
<div class="outer_box">:
This acts as the main container, keeping the content centered and padded nicely on the screen.

<div class="inner_box">:
This section contains the main content, including the balance and two action buttons (Deposit, Withdraw).

<h1>$0</h1>:
Displays the current account balance.

<button>:
Two separate buttons for:

Deposit

Withdraw

CSS Styling Highlights
Body Styling:

Background color is light grey (#e0e0e0) for a soft, modern look.

Uses flexbox to center the form both vertically and horizontally (justify-content: center, align-items: center).

height: 100vh ensures full screen coverage.

Outer Box (outer_box):

Acts as a wrapper with padding and rounded corners.

Includes a subtle box shadow for depth.

Gives the interface a card-like appearance.

Inner Box (inner_box):

Holds the balance and buttons in a center-aligned column layout.

White background to contrast with the outer box.

Additional padding and border-radius for a soft UI look.

Typography and Colors:

Headline (h1) uses a dark grey color (#333) for good readability.

Font is clean and professional (Arial, sans-serif).

Buttons:

Deposit button is green (#28a745) – signals a positive action.

Withdraw button is red (#dc3545) – signals a deduction.

Buttons are rounded with padding for better touch usability.

 Responsive Design Aspects
The use of flexbox allows the form to remain centered across all device sizes.

Text and buttons are scalable and spaced with margins and paddings.

The design automatically adjusts based on the screen without any media queries due to the flexible layout.

 Use Case / Application
This layout is perfect as a starting point for a banking or finance web app.

Can later be extended with JavaScript to:

Update balance
Handle actual deposit/withdrawal logic
Store transaction history.
