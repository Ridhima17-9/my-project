This project consists of creating a student registration form with the following features:

Form Fields:
Name

Input Type: text

Placeholder: “Enter your full name”

Validation: Should not be empty (can be enhanced with required attribute)

Email

Input Type: email

Placeholder: “Enter your email”

Validation: Uses HTML5 email format validation. If the input doesn’t match the email format, form submission will be blocked.

Age

Input Type: number

Placeholder: “Enter”

Validation: Accepts numeric input only. Can be further enhanced with min and max attributes to restrict age range.

Submit Button

A simple button with type submit labeled "Register".

When clicked, the browser checks for input validation using HTML5 form validation mechanisms.

Code Structure Highlights:
The form is wrapped inside a <div> container with the class "form-container" for styling purposes.

Each input is clearly labeled using <label> tags for accessibility.

The placeholder attribute in inputs provides user-friendly guidance.

While the current code is functional, adding the required attribute to each input can ensure the user must fill all fields before submission.

HTML5 Validation Features Used:
type="email" ensures a proper email format.

type="number" restricts non-numeric entries in the age field.

Validation is performed in the browser, reducing the need for JavaScript or server-side checking initially.

The design supports basic form validation without requiring a page reload or additional scripting.

Visual & Functional Benefits:
Clean and minimal layout using structured HTML

User-friendly guidance with placeholders

Built-in validation improves user experience and data accuracy

Can be easily extended with additional fields (e.g., course, phone number, etc.)

Ready for styling with CSS (style.css is linked but not included in the snippet)

Conclusion:
This project is an excellent example of how to build a functional and validated web form using only HTML5. It demonstrates:

Semantic HTML structure

Client-side validation for better user input handling

A clear and organized form layout suitable for any educational or academic portal.
