The main objective of this project is to design a fully responsive and visually appealing Admin Dashboard using HTML and CSS Grid layout techniques. Additionally, the dashboard includes a theme switching feature that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes without refreshing the page. This functionality enhances the user experience, making the interface both modern and accessible.

Task Description:
The dashboard is organized into four primary sections, all structured using CSS Grid:

1. Header

4. Footer

A simple line of text:
Â© 2025 Admin Dashboard. All rights reserved.

Purpose:
